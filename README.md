# TAssist
I have built this app by using Flask and Python. It is a remainder app. It send remainder emails to the user. The emails would contain the body, title, and any additional description of the event.

After you clone the repos, you would have to install Flask and all the side compunents which are imported initially in the file app.py, inside the app folder. After you have installed all the dependencies, cd into the app folder by using a terminal of powershell and run app.py.
